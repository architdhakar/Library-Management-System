##  How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites
1.  **C++ Compiler**: A modern C++ compiler (like GCC, Clang, or MSVC) that supports C++17.
2.  **CMake**: Version 3.10 or higher.
3.  **SQLite3 Development Library**:
    * **On Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsqlite3-dev`
    * **On Fedora/CentOS**: `sudo dnf install cmake make gcc-c++ sqlite-devel`
    * **On macOS (with Homebrew)**: `brew install cmake sqlite3`

### Build Steps
1.  Place all the source files (`.cpp`, `.h`, `CMakeLists.txt`) in your project directory.

2.  Open a terminal in your project directory and run the following commands:
    ```bash
    # Create a separate directory for build files
    mkdir build
    cd build

    # Configure the project with CMake
    cmake ..

    # Compile the source code
    make
    ```

### Run the Application
After a successful build, an executable named `library_backend` (or `library_backend.exe` on Windows) will be created in the `build` directory. Run it from your main project directory:

```bash
# Go back to the main project directory from 'build'
cd ..

# Run the executable
./build/library_backend
```
